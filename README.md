# Web Programming Final Project - Restaurant Tinder

Created by Ranjan Sikand, Sayed Yoseph Sadat, and Muhammed Halbutogullari

## Issues

### There are some bugs:

- If no resturants are returned, the game never loads/works. This happens with obscure cuisine types.
  As a solution, we indicate to the players when the search returned no results so they can start over.

- The game occassionally messes up and declares the wrong restaurant as the winner.

- Ocassionally the CPU is overloaded and the app needs to be refreshed.
